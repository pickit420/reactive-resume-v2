## Status Page

You can monitor the health and availability of Reactive Resume's servers at any time by visiting our status page:

<Card title="Status Page" icon="signal" href="https://status.rxresume.org">
  View real-time server metrics including uptime, CPU usage, memory usage, and more.
</Card>

The status page provides information such as:

- **Uptime**: How long the servers have been running without interruption
- **CPU Usage**: Current processor utilization
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption across services
- **Response Times**: How quickly the servers are responding to requests

## What to Do If Servers Are Down

If you notice the servers are experiencing high load or downtime, here are some recommendations:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the status page">
    Visit [status.rxresume.org](https://status.rxresume.org) to confirm if there's an ongoing issue. The page will show you the current state of all services.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait and try again later">
    If the servers are under heavy load, the best course of action is to wait a bit and try again later. Peak usage times can cause temporary slowdowns.

    <Info>
      Reactive Resume is a **free, open-source service** used by thousands of people worldwide. During peak times, the servers may experience higher than usual load.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check for announcements">
    For major outages or planned maintenance, announcements may be posted on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pickit420/reactive-resume-v2).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## A Note on Server Capacity

<Warning>
  Reactive Resume is a **free service** that runs on limited server resources. As an open-source project maintained by a single developer, it's not feasible to invest in powerful dedicated servers without community support.
</Warning>

The reality is:

- **High demand**: Thousands of users rely on this service daily
- **Limited resources**: As a free service, server capacity is constrained
- **No corporate backing**: This isn't a venture-funded startup with unlimited cloud budgets

If you find Reactive Resume valuable and want to help keep the servers running smoothly (and maybe even help scale them up), please consider supporting the project.
