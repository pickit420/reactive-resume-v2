A cover letter is a personalized document that accompanies your resume when applying for a job. It introduces you to the employer, highlights your relevant qualifications, and explains why you're a good fit for the position. Reactive Resume lets you create cover letters as custom sections, giving you full control over formatting and placement.

## Why include a cover letter?

- **Stand out**: A well-written cover letter demonstrates genuine interest in the position
- **Personalize your application**: Tailor your message to each employer and role
- **Explain gaps or transitions**: Address career changes or gaps in your resume
- **Show communication skills**: Demonstrate your ability to write clearly and professionally

## Creating a cover letter section

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the resume builder">
    Navigate to your resume and open it in the builder.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scroll to Custom Sections">
    In the left sidebar, scroll down to find the **Custom Sections** area at the bottom.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a new custom section">
    Click <Badge>Add a new custom section</Badge> to open the section creation dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select 'Cover Letter' as the type">
    In the dialog:
    - Enter a **Title** for your section (e.g., "Cover Letter" or "Cover Letter - [Company Name]")
    - Select **Cover Letter** from the **Type** dropdown
    - Click **Create** to add the section
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add a cover letter item">
    In your new cover letter section, click <Badge>Add a new item</Badge> to create your cover letter.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Formatting your cover letter

A cover letter has two main fields:

### Recipient field

The **Recipient** field is where you enter the recipient's information. This typically includes:
- Date (optional)
- Hiring manager's name
- Their job title
- Company name
- Company address

<Tip>
  Use line breaks to format the address block. For example:

  ```
  January 31, 2026

  Jane Smith
  Senior Hiring Manager
  Acme Corporation
  123 Main Street, Suite 400
  New York, NY 10001
  ```
</Tip>

### Content field

The **Content** field is where you write the body of your cover letter. Include:
- **Salutation**: "Dear Ms. Smith," or "Dear Hiring Team,"
- **Opening paragraph**: State the position you're applying for and how you learned about it
- **Body paragraphs**: Highlight relevant experience, skills, and achievements
- **Closing paragraph**: Express enthusiasm and include a call to action
- **Sign-off**: "Sincerely," followed by your name

<Info>
  The recipient and content are both rendered directly on your resume without a section header, giving your cover letter a clean, professional appearance.

## Using fullscreen mode for writing

For a distraction-free writing experience, use the fullscreen mode in the rich text editor:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the cover letter item">
    Click on your cover letter item in the sidebar to open the edit dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Expand the editor">
    In either the Recipient or Content field, click the **expand icon** (arrows pointing outward) in the bottom-right corner of the editor.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write in fullscreen">
    The editor will expand to nearly fill your screen, giving you a focused writing environment with all formatting tools available.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Exit fullscreen">
    Click the **collapse icon** or press **Escape** to return to the normal view.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Formatting options

The rich text editor supports various formatting options for your cover letter:

- **Text styling**: Bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, highlight
- **Headings**: H1 through H6 (though typically not needed in a cover letter)
- **Alignment**: Left, center, right, or justified text
- **Lists**: Bullet points and numbered lists
- **Links**: Add hyperlinks to your portfolio or LinkedIn

## Moving your cover letter to a separate page

Cover letters are typically on their own page, separate from the resume content. To achieve this:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a second page">
    In the right sidebar, go to the **Layout** section and add a new page to your resume.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move the cover letter section">
    Use the **Move to** feature to relocate your cover letter section to the second page.

    <Tip>
      See [Moving items between sections](/guides/moving-items-between-sections) for detailed instructions on how to move sections between pages.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the layout">
    Check the preview to ensure your cover letter appears on its own page with proper formatting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  When exporting as PDF, pages are rendered in order. If you want the cover letter first, place it on page 1 and move your resume content to subsequent pages.
</Warning>

## Tips for effective cover letters

<Tip>
  **Keep it concise**: Aim for 250-400 words. Recruiters spend about one minute reading cover letters.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Tailor each letter**: Customize your cover letter for each application. Reference specific job requirements and company values.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use the same styling**: Your cover letter will inherit the fonts and colors from your resume template, ensuring a cohesive look.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Proofread carefully**: Spelling and grammar errors can disqualify your application. Review your letter before exporting.
</Tip>

## Managing multiple cover letters

Since cover letters are custom sections, you can:

- Create multiple cover letter sections for different job applications
- Name each section descriptively (e.g., "Cover Letter - Google", "Cover Letter - Meta")
- Show or hide sections as needed when exporting
- Duplicate sections to use as templates for new applications
