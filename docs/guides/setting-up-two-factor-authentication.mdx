<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure you have a password set">
    In order to see the option to set up two-factor authentication, you need to set a password. If you haven't set a password yet, possibly because you created your account through signing in with Google or GitHub, you will not be able to follow along this guide.

    <Warning>
      Two-factor authentication requires a password to be set on your account. If you signed up using a social provider (Google or GitHub), you'll need to set a password first from the Authentication settings page.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign in to the dashboard">
    Head over to [https://rxresume.org](https://rxresume.org) and sign in with your account credentials.

    <Tip>
      If you haven't created an account yet, follow the guide on [Creating an Account](/guides/creating-an-account).

  <Step title="Navigate to Authentication settings">
    Once you're in the dashboard, look for the sidebar navigation on the left. Under the <Badge>Settings</Badge> section, click on the <Badge>Authentication</Badge> link.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click on Enable 2FA">
    On the Authentication page, find the <Badge>Two-Factor Authentication</Badge> section and click on the <Badge>Enable 2FA</Badge> button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your password">
    You will be asked to re-enter your password to authenticate that it's really you. Enter your password and click continue.

    <Info>
      This password verification step ensures that only authorized users can enable two-factor authentication on your account.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Scan the QR code">
    After entering your password, you should be shown a QR code. Scan it with your authenticator device and enter the 6-digit code that the app provides to continue.

    <Tip>
      Popular authenticator apps you can use include:
      - **Google Authenticator** - Available on iOS and Android
      - **Microsoft Authenticator** - Available on iOS and Android
      - **Authy** - Available on iOS, Android, and desktop
      - **1Password** - Available on multiple platforms
      - **LastPass Authenticator** - Available on iOS and Android
    </Tip>

    <Info>
      You can also copy the secret key above the QR code and paste it into your authenticator app if you prefer manual entry.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save your backup codes">
    Once verified, you'll be prompted to save backup codes. You can use each code only once, and they're useful if you ever happen to lose access to your authenticator device.

    <Warning>
      Make sure to copy and store these backup codes in a safe place. If you lose your authenticator device and don't have backup codes, you may lose access to your account.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Sign in with 2FA">
    The next time you sign in, you will be asked for a one-time code from your authenticator app. Enter the 6-digit code displayed in your authenticator app to complete the sign-in process.

    <Tip>
      If you've lost access to your authenticator device, you can use one of your backup codes to sign in. Remember that each backup code can only be used once.
