title: "Exporting your resume"
description: "Learn how to export your resume as a PDF or JSON file, and discover how JSON exports can be used with AI assistants like ChatGPT or Claude."
---

Reactive Resume lets you export your resume in two formats: **PDF** and **JSON**. Each format serves a different purpose—PDFs are ideal for sharing with recruiters and uploading to job applications, while JSON files are perfect for backups, importing into other tools, or working with AI assistants.

## Where to find the Export section

In the resume builder, open the **right sidebar** and select **Export**.

You'll see two export options:

- **JSON** - Download a machine-readable copy of your resume data
- **PDF** - Download a print-ready version of your resume

## Exporting as PDF

Click the **PDF** button to generate and download a PDF version of your resume.

<Info>
  The PDF is rendered server-side using your current resume data and template settings. What you see in the preview is what you'll get in the PDF, split into multiple pages if necessary.
</Info>

### When to use PDF exports

- **Job applications** - Most applicant tracking systems (ATS) accept PDF uploads
- **Sharing with recruiters** - PDFs are universally readable and preserve your formatting
- **Printing** - PDFs are print-ready and maintain exact layout on paper
- **Email attachments** - Easy to attach and share via email

<Tip>
  Before exporting, double-check your resume in the live preview.
</Tip>

## Exporting as JSON

Click the **JSON** button to download your resume as a JSON file.

The JSON file contains your **complete resume data**, including:

- Personal information (name, email, phone, location, etc.)
- All sections (experience, education, projects, skills, etc.)
- Custom sections
- Template and design settings (colors, fonts, layout, spacing)
- Metadata (page format, margins, typography)

### When to use JSON exports

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Backup and version control" icon="floppy-disk">
    Keep local backups of your resume data. If you ever need to restore or compare versions, you can import the JSON file back into Reactive Resume.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Import into Reactive Resume" icon="file-import">
    You can import a JSON export back into Reactive Resume to create a new resume based on that data. This is useful for creating variations or restoring from a backup.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use with AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)" icon="robot">
    JSON files are structured data that AI assistants can read and understand. You can share your resume JSON with an AI to get suggestions, rewrites, or entirely new content tailored to a specific job.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Using JSON exports with AI assistants

One of the most powerful uses for JSON exports is working with AI assistants like **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, or other LLMs. Because the JSON file contains structured, machine-readable data, AI assistants can:

1. **Read and understand your resume** - The AI can parse your experience, skills, and other sections
2. **Suggest improvements** - Ask the AI to rewrite bullet points, improve descriptions, or suggest keywords
3. **Tailor your resume** - Provide a job description and ask the AI to modify your resume to match
4. **Generate cover letters** - Use your resume data to draft a matching cover letter
5. **Create multiple versions** - Ask the AI to create variations for different roles or industries

### Example workflow with an AI assistant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Export your resume as JSON">
    In the resume builder, go to **Export** and click **JSON** to download your resume data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share the JSON with your AI assistant">
    Upload the JSON file to ChatGPT, Claude, or paste its contents into the chat. You can say something like:

    > "Here is my resume in JSON format. Please review it and suggest improvements for a Senior Software Engineer role at a fintech company."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask the AI to modify the JSON">
    The AI can make changes directly to the JSON structure. For example:

    > "Please update my experience descriptions to be more quantitative and action-oriented. Return the modified JSON."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Import the modified JSON back into Reactive Resume">
    1. Go to your **Dashboard**
    2. Click **Import an existing resume**
    3. Select **Reactive Resume (JSON)** as the type
    4. Upload the modified JSON file

    A new resume will be created with the AI's changes applied.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Always review AI-generated changes before using them. AI assistants can make mistakes or suggest content that doesn't accurately reflect your experience.
</Warning>

### Example prompts for AI assistants

Here are some prompts you can use after sharing your resume JSON:

| Goal | Example Prompt |
|------|----------------|
| General review | "Review my resume and suggest 3-5 improvements to make it more impactful." |
| Tailor to a job | "Here's a job description for [role]. Update my resume JSON to better match this position." |
| Improve bullet points | "Rewrite my experience descriptions to start with strong action verbs and include metrics where possible." |
| Add keywords | "Add relevant keywords for [industry/role] to my skills and experience sections." |
| Shorten resume | "Condense my resume to fit on one page while keeping the most important information." |
| Create a summary | "Write a compelling 2-3 sentence professional summary based on my experience." |

## JSON schema reference

The exported JSON follows the Reactive Resume schema. Here's a high-level overview of the structure:
