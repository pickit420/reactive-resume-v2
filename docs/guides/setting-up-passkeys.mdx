  </Step>

  <Step title="Name your passkey">
    You'll be prompted to enter a name for the passkey. Use something descriptive so you can recognize it later (for example, “MacBook Touch ID” or “iPhone Face ID”).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the passkey prompt">
    Your browser or device will show a passkey prompt (WebAuthn). Follow the on-screen instructions to register your passkey using your biometric (Face ID / Touch ID / fingerprint) or device PIN.

    <Info>
      Passkeys are tied to your device (or password manager) and are a more secure alternative to passwords.

  <Step title="Manage passkeys (optional)">
    After registering, your passkey will show up in the list. You can delete a passkey using the trash icon next to it.
