  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate to the sign up page">
    You should see a link that says <Badge>Don't have an account? Create one now →</Badge>. Click on that link to go to the sign up page and you should see a form.

  <Step title="Fill in your details">
    Complete the sign up form with the following information:
    
    - **Name**: Your full name
    - **Email Address**: A valid email address you have access to.
    - **Username**: Choose a unique username (this will be used in your public resume URLs)
    - **Password**: Create a strong password

    <Warning>
      Make sure to choose a username you're happy with, as it will be part of your public resume URL (e.g., `rxresume.org/your-username/resume-slug`).

  <Step title="Sign up and log in">
    After filling in all the required fields, click the **Sign Up** button. You will be immediately logged in and can start using Reactive Resume right away.

    <Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Username Already Taken">
    If you see an error that your username is already taken, try a different variation. Usernames must be unique across all users.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Email Already Registered">
    If your email is already registered, you can use the **Forgot Password** link on the login page to reset your password and regain access to your account.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Didn't Receive Verification Email">
    Check your spam folder first. If you still don't see it, you can request a new verification email from your account settings.
