## The previous version is still available

If you've been using Reactive Resume for a while, you may have resumes saved in the previous version of the application. The good news is that **version 4 (v4) is still fully accessible** and will remain online for the foreseeable future.

<Info>
  The previous version of Reactive Resume is available at [https://v1.rxresume.org](https://v1.rxresume.org).
</Info>

## Why keep the old version running?

There are several reasons why v4 remains available:

- **Access to existing resumes**: Users who created resumes in v4 can still access, edit, and export them
- **Familiarity**: Some users may prefer the interface they're already comfortable with
- **Transition time**: Moving to a new version takes time, and there's no rush

## How long will v4 be available?

The previous version will continue to run for as long as possible—until the maintainer runs out of breath or funds to keep the server active. There are no immediate plans to shut it down.

<Warning>
  While v4 will remain accessible for the foreseeable future, I recommend gradually transitioning to the latest version to benefit from new features, improvements, and ongoing support.
</Warning>

## Accessing your v4 resumes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit the v4 application">
    Go to [https://v1.rxresume.org](https://v1.rxresume.org) in your browser.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Log in with your existing credentials">
    Use the same account credentials you used when you originally created your resumes in v4.

    <Tip>
      If you used social login (Google, GitHub, etc.) in v4, use the same method to sign in.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access your resumes">
    Once logged in, you'll find all your previously created resumes in your dashboard, exactly as you left them.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Migrating to the new version

If you'd like to move your resumes to the latest version of Reactive Resume, you can export them from v4 and import them into the new version:

1. In v4, open the resume you want to migrate
2. Export it as a JSON file
3. In the new version at [https://rxresume.org](https://rxresume.org), create a new account or log in
4. Use the import feature to upload your JSON file (select the "Reactive Resume v4 (JSON)" option)

<Info>
  Your existing resumes should already be available in the new version. If you don't see them, you can manually import them using the steps above.
