Reactive Resume lets you share your resume via a **public URL** that anyone can access. When you make your resume public, it becomes available at a unique link that you can share with recruiters, include in your portfolio, or add to your LinkedIn profile.

## How to enable public sharing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your resume in the builder">
    Navigate to your resume in the resume builder.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Go to the Sharing section">
    In the **right sidebar**, select **Sharing**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle 'Allow Public Access'">
    Turn on the **Allow Public Access** switch. Once enabled, your resume will be accessible via its public URL.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your public URL">
    Your public URL is displayed below the toggle. It follows this format:

    ```
    https://rxresume.org/{username}/{slug}
    ```

    Click the **copy** button to copy the URL to your clipboard.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The `{slug}` is the unique, URL-safe name you assign to your resume when you create it. If you want to change your slug, go to the dashboard, right-click your resume card, and choose "Update" to edit its details.
</Tip>

## How the public URL works

When someone visits your public resume URL:

1. **They see the live version** - The page renders your current resume data with all your latest changes
2. **No account required** - Visitors don't need a Reactive Resume account to view or download your resume
3. **They can print or save as PDF** - Visitors can use their browser's print function to save a PDF copy
4. **Views are tracked** - Each visit is counted in your resume statistics (see below)

<Info>
  Changes you make in the builder are reflected immediately on the public URL. There's no separate "publish" step—your public resume is always in sync.
</Info>

## Tracking views and downloads

When your resume is public, Reactive Resume tracks how many times it has been viewed and downloaded. This helps you understand engagement and see if people are actually looking at your resume.

### Where to find statistics

In the resume builder, open the **right sidebar** and select **Statistics**.

You'll see:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Views** | Number of times your public resume page was visited |
| **Last viewed** | The date when your resume was last viewed |
| **Downloads** | Number of times your resume was downloaded (via the public page) |
| **Last downloaded** | The date when your resume was last downloaded |

<Info>
  Statistics are only tracked when your resume is **public**. If you turn off public access, tracking pauses but your existing stats are preserved.
</Info>

### What counts as a view?

A view is counted each time someone loads your public resume page. This includes:

- Direct visits to your public URL
- Clicks from links you've shared
- Search engine visits (if your resume is indexed)

<Note>
  Only **you** can see your resume's statistics. Visitors to your public URL cannot see how many views or downloads your resume has.
</Note>

## Password protecting your resume

If you want to share your resume with specific people but keep it private from the general public, you can add password protection.

When password protection is enabled:

- Visitors must enter the correct password to view your resume
- The password prompt appears before any resume content is shown
- You can share the password separately with trusted individuals

### How to set a password

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable public access">
    First, make sure **Allow Public Access** is turned on in the **Sharing** section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Set Password'">
    Below the public URL, click the **Set Password** button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter your password">
    Type a password (6-64 characters) and confirm. This password will be required to view your resume.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share the password separately">
    Share the password with your intended audience through a secure channel (e.g., direct message, email).
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Choose a password you're comfortable sharing. Anyone with the password can view and download your resume.
</Warning>

### How to remove password protection

If you no longer need password protection:

1. Go to the **Sharing** section in the right sidebar
2. Click **Remove Password**
3. Confirm the action

Your resume will become accessible to anyone with the public URL.

## Turning off public access

To make your resume private again:

1. Go to the **Sharing** section in the right sidebar
2. Turn off the **Allow Public Access** switch

When public access is disabled:

- Your public URL returns a "not found" error
- Existing links stop working immediately
- Your statistics are preserved (they'll resume if you re-enable public access)
- Password protection settings are preserved

<Tip>
  If you only want to temporarily hide your resume, consider using password protection instead of disabling public access entirely. This way, your URL remains active for people who have the password.
</Tip>

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I customize my public URL?">
    Yes! The URL is based on your **username** and the resume's **slug**. You can change the slug in the **Update Resume** dialog. To open it, right-click on your resume card in the dashboard and select "Update". The username is set in your account settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will search engines index my public resume?">
    Public resumes may be indexed by search engines. If you want to prevent indexing, use password protection or keep your resume private.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do views from my own visits count?">
    Views are only counted when someone visits your public resume URL while not logged in. Visits made while you're logged in to your account are not included in the view statistics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see who viewed my resume?">
    No, Reactive Resume only tracks view and download counts, not the identity of visitors. This protects visitor privacy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I change my username?">
    Your public URL will change to reflect the new username. Old URLs will stop working immediately. You might need to update any links you've shared.
