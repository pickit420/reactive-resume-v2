<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to the dashboard">
    Head over to [https://rxresume.org](https://rxresume.org) and sign in with your account credentials.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Navigate to Artificial Intelligence settings">
    Once you're in the dashboard, look for the sidebar navigation on the left. Under the <Badge>Settings</Badge> section, click on <Badge>Artificial Intelligence</Badge>.
  </Step>

  <Step title="How your data is stored and sent">
    When you configure your AI provider settings on this page, all information (such as the API key and model) is stored locally in your browser and **not** in our database.

    <Info>
      <strong>Your credentials and AI configuration are never saved on Reactive Resume servers.</strong> They only live in your device's browser storage.
    </Info>

    However, whenever you use an AI-assisted feature (such as text generation), these credentials need to be sent to the server **temporarily and only for the duration of your request**. This is required to connect with the AI provider on your behalf. See below for a deeper explanation.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose a provider">
    In the <Badge>Provider</Badge> field, choose one of the supported providers:

    - **OpenAI**
    - **Google Gemini**
    - **Anthropic Claude**
    - **Ollama** (coming soon)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a model name">
    In the <Badge>Model</Badge> field, enter the model you want to use (for example, <code>gpt-5.2</code>, <code>claude-4.5-opus</code>, or <code>gemini-3-flash</code>).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste your API key">
    In the <Badge>API Key</Badge> field, paste your provider API key.

    <Warning>
      Treat this key like a password. Anyone with it can use your provider account and may incur costs.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify it's enabled">
    After setting the provider, model, and API key, the status indicator at the bottom of the page should show <Badge>Enabled</Badge>.

    <Tip>
      If the status shows <Badge>Disabled</Badge>, double-check that all three fields are filled in.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why AI requests are sent through our server

Most AI providers (like OpenAI, Gemini, or Anthropic) block requests that come directly from the browser due to something called **CORS** ("Cross-Origin Resource Sharing"), a security mechanism built into web browsers.  

**What is CORS?**  
CORS is a browser feature that prevents web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page, unless that domain explicitly allows it. Most AI providers do not allow browser-based requests from random websites, primarily for security and abuse prevention.

Because of this restriction, the app has to **forward your AI requests (along with your credentials) through our server**, which then contacts the AI provider and returns the response to your browser. **Your credentials are not stored on our server; they are only used to make the request you initiated, and are not logged or retained.**

<Info>
  If you're curious or would like to audit how your AI requests are forwarded, you can review the code yourself.
  See the relevant implementation in <code>src/integrations/orpc/router/ai.ts</code> within the codebase.
</Info>

### Do you know a workaround?

If you have a solution or workaround for this CORS-related limitation, please consider raising an [issue or pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/reactive-resume/reactive-resume).
