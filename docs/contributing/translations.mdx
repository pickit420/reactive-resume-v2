description: "Help translate Reactive Resume into your language using Crowdin"
---

Reactive Resume is used by people all around the world, and translations help make the app accessible to everyone. If you speak a language other than English, you can help by contributing translations.

---

## How Translations Work

Reactive Resume uses [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/) as its localization management platform. Crowdin provides a user-friendly interface where translators can contribute translations without needing to write code or work with files directly.

<Info>
  The Reactive Resume Crowdin project is available at [https://crowdin.com/project/lazymedia-reactive-resume](https://crowdin.com/project/lazymedia-reactive-resume).
</Info>

Once translations are submitted and approved on Crowdin, they are automatically synced to the codebase and will be available in the next release of the app.

## Translation Guidelines

To maintain consistency across all translations, please follow these guidelines:

### Preserve Placeholders

Some strings contain placeholders like `{name}` or `{count}`. These must remain unchanged in your translation:

```
English: "Hello, {name}!"
Spanish: "¡Hola, {name}!"
```

### Keep Formatting

Preserve any HTML tags or markdown formatting in the source text:

```
English: "Click <1>here</1> to continue"
German: "Klicken Sie <1>hier</1>, um fortzufahren"
```

### Use Formal or Informal Tone Consistently

Choose either formal or informal language based on what's standard for software in your language, and stick with it throughout.

### Technical Terms

Some technical terms (like "PDF", "URL", "JSON") are often kept in English across languages. Use your judgment based on what's common in your language's software community.

## Requesting a New Language

If your language is not listed in the Crowdin project, you can request it to be added.

<Warning>
  Before requesting a new language, please check if it's already available in the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/lazymedia-reactive-resume).
</Warning>

To request a new language:

1. Go to the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/pickit420/reactive-resume-v2/issues) page
2. Click **New Issue**
3. Select the appropriate template or create a blank issue
4. Title it something like: "Add [Language Name] to Reactive Resume"
5. Include the language name and locale code (e.g., "Japanese - ja-JP") in the issue description.

Once approved, the language will be added to Crowdin and you can begin translating.

## When Will My Translations Appear?

Translations submitted on Crowdin are synced to the codebase periodically. Once merged, they will be included in the next release of Reactive Resume.

<Info>
  There may be a delay between submitting translations and seeing them live in the app. This is normal and depends on the release cycle.
