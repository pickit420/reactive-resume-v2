## The Service

Reactive Resume is a resume builder that allows you to create, store, and share resumes, upload related assets, and export/print resumes (including generating PDFs and screenshots).

---

## Eligibility

You must be legally able to form a contract in your jurisdiction to use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you are authorized to bind that organization to these Terms.

---

## Accounts and Security

- **Account information**: You agree to provide accurate information and keep it up to date.
- **Credentials**: You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for activities that occur under your account.
- **Security features**: Where available, you should enable 2FA or passkeys to improve account security.

The Service Operator may suspend or terminate accounts to protect the Service, other users, or to comply with legal obligations.

---

## Your Content

### What you provide
“Content” includes the resume data you enter or import (text, links, personal details, etc.) and any files you upload (e.g., profile pictures).

### Ownership
You retain ownership of your Content.

### License to operate the Service
You grant the Service Operator a limited license to host, store, process, and display your Content **only as necessary** to provide the Service (for example, to render your resume in the builder, generate PDFs, serve uploaded images, or show a public resume page you publish).

### Public resumes and sharing
If you set a resume as **public** or share a link, you understand that anyone with access to that link may view (and potentially copy) the content you make available. You are responsible for what you choose to publish.

If you password-protect a resume, you are responsible for controlling distribution of that password.

---

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for unlawful, harmful, or abusive activities
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to accounts, systems, or data
- Upload malware, exploit code, or content designed to disrupt the Service
- Use automated means to scrape, overload, or interfere with the Service without permission
- Infringe intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of others

The Service Operator may remove Content or restrict access if needed to enforce these Terms or comply with law.

---

## Uploads, Storage, and Delivery

Uploaded files may be stored on the Service Operator's infrastructure and may be served back to you (and, if your resume is public, to others). Depending on configuration, storage may be local filesystem storage or S3-compatible object storage.

You represent that you have the rights necessary to upload and use any files and that doing so does not violate any law or third-party rights.

---

## Exports (PDF) and Screenshots

When you request a PDF export or screenshot, the Service uses a printer service (a headless Chromium browser) to load a resume URL and generate the output.

Depending on the deployment, this rendering service may be operated by the Service Operator or a third party. You understand that resume content must be processed for rendering in order to provide the export/screenshot functionality.

---

## Third-Party Services (Optional)

The Service may integrate with third parties depending on configuration and your choices, including:

- OAuth providers (e.g., Google/GitHub/custom OAuth) for sign-in
- Storage providers (S3-compatible)
- AI providers (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic) if you enable AI features and provide your own API key

Your use of third-party services may be subject to their own terms and policies. The Service Operator is not responsible for third-party services outside its control.

---

## API Keys (If Enabled)

If the Service allows you to create API keys:

- You are responsible for keeping API keys secure and rotating/revoking them if compromised.
- The Service Operator may enforce rate limits, quotas, and permissions.
- Misuse of API keys may result in suspension or termination.

---

## Intellectual Property and Open Source

Reactive Resume is open-source software licensed under the **MIT License**. These Terms govern **use of the Service**, not the open-source license for the code.

See the docs [License page](/legal/license) for details.

---

## Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. The Service Operator may suspend or terminate your access:

- To enforce these Terms
- To address security risks or abuse
- To comply with legal requirements

Upon termination, your ability to access Content may be removed. Retention/deletion of data depends on the Service Operator's policies and legal obligations.

---

## Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** AND **“AS AVAILABLE”** WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

The Service Operator does not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that exports will always succeed.

---

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE OPERATOR WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE SERVICE.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICE OPERATOR'S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) TO USE THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

---

## Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Service Operator from and against claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses arising from:

- Your Content
- Your misuse of the Service
- Your violation of these Terms

---

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time. Updated Terms will be posted on this page with a new effective date. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.

---

## Governing Law

These terms are governed by the laws of the **Federal Republic of Germany**.
